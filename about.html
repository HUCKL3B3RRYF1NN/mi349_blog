      <p><img src="/images/Me.jpg" alt="Photo of me, Michael Huckleberry"></p>
      <p>Hello, my name is Michael Huckleberry. I am a Senior at Michigan State University studying Games & Interactive Media with a focus in video game development and an interest in UI/UX design. I am hoping to start my career as a junior game developer or in some other related design position. I enjoy developing 2D Platformers and experimenting with minimalistic designs. </p>
      <p>Here at MSU, I am a member of the Spartan Marching Band where I serve as a section leader for the trumpet section. Throughout my time in the SMB, I have performed in multiple NFL stadiums, including Mercedez-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, GA, and Ford Field in Detroit, MI. Additionally, I have traveled to and performed in multiple cities in Austria, including Salzburg, Schladming, and Vienna. The largest crowd I have performed for with the SMB was over 110,000 people at the Big House in Ann Arbor. </p>
