          <p>Recently, I have picked up the sport of Disc Golf once again. I have always enjoyed playing Disc Golf and other games involving a frisbee.<br>          
          <br> My family and I would spend plenty of weekends in the summer and fall disc golfing at different courses throughout the state. When I was in High School, my hometown created a disc golf course that was right across the street from my house. Needless to say, I spent countless hours out on that course.<br>        
          <br>However, once I got to college, I haven’t been able to play as much because of a lack of equipment and I had no one around me that was very interested in the sport. I ended up joining an intramural Ultimate Frisbee team during my junior year here at MSU because I did miss throwing a frisbee around.<br>        
          <br>When school started this year, I became friends with someone who is a big fan of Disc Golf. This caused me to start spending more weekends back on Disc Golf courses around the East Lansing area.<br>
          <br>I have played at the Trinity Church Disc Golf Course multiple times in the past month, averaging a score of +14. I’m excited to keep playing and working towards lowering my score in the future.</p>

        <h3>Let's Go Lions!</h3>

          <p>I am a big sports fan! I love watching college basketball, college football, college hockey, and the NFL, NHL, and MLB. I enjoy watching the NFL most of all.<br>       
          <br>I love getting to root on my Detroit Lions every Sunday. Just a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to go to my first ever NFL game ever when the Detroit Lions took on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was an amazing experience! I loved feeling the energy of the unforgiving home crowd in Ford Field along with getting to see some of my favorite players such as Jared Goff and Amon-ra St. Brown in-person for the first time.<br>          
          <br>Unfortunately however, the Detroit Lions lost that game, bringing their record to 1-1 on the season. Since then, the lions have gone 2-0, seeing them head into their upcoming game against the Dallas Cowboys at 3-1 which is good enough to claim second place in the NFC North.<br>        
          <br>I have been highly anticipating this season ever since last season ended in tragic fashion as the Detroit Lions fell apart in the second half of the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49’ers with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. So far, I can not complain about anything as the Lions are well on their way to another trip to the playoffs this year with a legitimate shot at winning the Super Bowl! Let’s go Lions!</p>
